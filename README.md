Hey there! I recently took on a fun project to test out my computer vision skills. Using Python, along with the Mediapipe and OpenCV libraries, I attempted to recreate the magic circles that appear on Doctor Strange's palms when he's casting spells. Yep, just like the Marvel hero!

Here's a quick rundown of how it works:

Hand Gesture Detection: The script kicks off by detecting hand gestures using your device's camera.
Calculating the Palm Midpoint: It calculates the midpoint of your palm and checks how open your hand is.
Applying the Magic Circle: If your hand is open enough, it creates a mask (the magic circle) from pre-supplied images and places it at the calculated midpoint on your palm.
That's the simple version! There are plenty of interesting aspects, like understanding perspective, rotating image objects, and creating transparent overlays.

Hope this project gives you some insights into these cool topics! ðŸ˜Š
